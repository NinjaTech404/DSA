# DSA in C++: A Journey Through Pain and Pointers

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++ because apparently, solving problems in Python wasn't masochistic enough.

## ü§î Why C++ for DSA?

Why? Cuz I hate myself! Also because:
- Memory management is like playing Russian roulette with segmentation faults
- Pointers are just fancy ways to get lost in memory
- Templates are black magic that sometimes work
- Who needs garbage collection when you can have memory leaks?

## üìö What's Inside This Beautiful Disaster

### Data Structures (Because Arrays Were Too Mainstream)

- **Linked Lists** - Because sometimes you want to traverse your entire list just to add one element
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO, FIFO, WTF? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Trees** - Because who doesn't love spending hours debugging recursive functions?
- **Graphs** - For when you really want to get lost in relationships (the data kind)
- **Hash Tables** - Magic boxes that sometimes work and sometimes don't

### Algorithms (The "Fun" Part)

- **Sorting Algorithms** - Because `std::sort()` was too easy
- **Searching Algorithms** - For when Ctrl+F isn't hardcore enough
- **Dynamic Programming** - Because regular programming wasn't confusing enough
- **Graph Algorithms** - Dijkstra, BFS, DFS - alphabet soup of pain!

## üöÄ Getting Started (Abandon All Hopes for Who Enters Here)

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or Visual C++ if you're into that)
- Lots of coffee ‚òï
- A therapist on speed dial
- The ability to cry silently at 3 AM

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository (and your sanity)
git clone https://github.com/NinjaTech404/DSA.git

# Navigate to the directory of regrets
cd DSA

# Compile everything (pray to the C++ gods)
cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make

# Run and embrace the segmentation faults
./MyRegrets
